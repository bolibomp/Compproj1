# Computer Project 1

When doing things in real life thing all of a sudden get way more complicated then your
average physics problem in a text book. Things like friction and air resistance become
a factor to consider and just the fact that you must rely on measurements, with all it’s
flaws, makes things quite the task to solve with just pen and paper.
This is were a computer come in handy. With a computer you can numerically solve a
problem, like ours, were we don’t know the initial values, or how hard we kicked the
lunch box, but only were it landed and how high it went.
